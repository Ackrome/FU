Allows Mixed Washes As the sheet protects against colour transfer it allows you to wash all colours together, even with whites. Colour Catcher protects your laundry and saves your time and money by allowing mixed washes.\n3. Protects Colour Brightness Even if not seen by the eye, traces of dye might deposit every wash and build up a layer of mixed colours on the garment over time - making your coloured garments dull. The sheets trap dyes from the water before they deposit on the garments. It helps to keep your colours brighter for longer!\n4. Prevents Greying Greying is an accumulation process. Grime and dirt are traces which redeposit on the fabric during several washes and their build-up becomes visible over time. By removing loose dirt particles from the wash the sheet protects the fabric from greying.\n5. Effective at All Temperatures Extra absorbent fibres of the sheet provides maximum protection at all temperatures. For best results use Colour Catcher in every wash.\n6.
